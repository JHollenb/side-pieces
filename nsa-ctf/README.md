For example, to access the "blind" challenge, ssh into the server and do nc localhost 1000.
[update Apr 17 17:22] Challenge escalate_it is accessible at http://54.161.125.246:1011/login.html.
[update Apr 17 18:07] We're working on the netcat connectivity from local machine. Please ssh into the server and do netcat there for now.
[update Apr 17 18:17] Remote connectivity issue is fixed. You can now connect to the challenges from your local machine: nc 54.161.125.246 1000.
